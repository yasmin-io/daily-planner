# Daily Planner

---

My current project is working on buidling a Daily Planner for those busy individuals who want to organise themselves abit better. Expanding my skillset by practicing [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/) in this project. By familiarising myself with different frameworks and libraries, it will help me create cleaner applications while saving time that can be put in other areas of my building a website's.

## Tasks

---

- The current day is displayed at the header of the page.
- Below are a display of TimeBlocks from 9am to 5pm.
- Clicking a timeblock allows the user to log an event for that hour.
- Clicking a 'save' button will save the text in their local storage.
- The page resets after that day.
- The slots will change color depending on if the event is in the past, future or current.

### Other Tips Improvements

- Following a design.
- Consolidating CSS selectors and properties in the CSS file.
