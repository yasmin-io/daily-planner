# Daily Planner

---

This project is working on building a Daily Planner for those busy individuals who want to organise themselves abit better. Expanding my skillset by practicing [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/) in this project. By familiarising myself with different frameworks and libraries, it will help me create cleaner applications while saving time that can be put in other areas of my building a website's. I thoroughly enjoyed this project, It was a fun exercise to use these new ways of styling and designing my websites.

## Tasks

---

- The current day is displayed at the header of the page.
- Below are a display of TimeBlocks from 9am to 5pm.
- Clicking a timeblock allows the user to log an event for that hour.
- Clicking a 'save' button will save the text in their local storage.
- The slots will change color depending on if the event is in the past, future or current.

### Other Tips Improvements to keep in mind

- Following a design.
- Consolidating CSS selectors and properties in the CSS file.

## Future Tests (Bugs & Fixes)

> There are currently bugs or corrections that need to be made.

### Updates

Future update ideas would be to experiment with ways to further improve the CSS and styling of the website. I would love to redesign it in my style, although following the mockup is a crucial skill. Despite this not being the best I can do with the styling and design, it is more beneficial to display that I am able to follow a that is presented to me.

Another would be to add a block colored 'save' logo for the button after the user has saved their task. This would be a nice extra feature for the user to be able to see when information has actually been saved, versus just typed but not saved.
